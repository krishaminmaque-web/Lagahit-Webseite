     As a graduate of the Sisters of Mary School — that mainly offers a Technical-Vocational Curriculum — technology has always big part of my journey and has undoubtedly had a significant place in my heart. Being a student who took EPAS NCII or Electronic Products Assembly and Servicing NCII, it has paved the way towards my interest on technology which later encouraged me to try the world of automation which then led me to Mechatronics.And now as a current 2nd year student of Central Philippine State University – MPC, my interest in technology became stronger and the thirst for information and knowledge served as my encouragement as I journey in the world of Information Technology.
