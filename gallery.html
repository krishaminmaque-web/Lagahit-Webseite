      <p>“Promotional poster designed in Adobe Photoshop for a tutorial series.” <br><br>


Multimedia has played a significant role in Information Technology. Here we used Adobe Photoshop an editing tool used by professionals in editing and enhancing photos, posters, banners etc. The image shown above is a basic example of a thumbnail often use on YouTube videos. The elements used were images, shapes and text. This project shows how layers are neatly arranged and the balance and contrast of each elements are emphasized.</p>

      <p>“An interactive e-commerce website prototype designed in Figma”<br><br>

Here I created an online shop prototype and named it “Shamade” which was taken from my name and was then combined to the word ‘made’. The name gives a very unique vibe while sounding like a luxury in a very affordable price. The main function of this online shop is the same as a typical online shop would do where you can choose and purchase clothes, shoes, bags and kid’s stuff. The functions are direct, easy to use and efficient.</p>

      <p>“Personal portfolio layout created using Canva’s visual tools” <br><br>


Canva is one of the most popular editing tools often use for educational, business and entertainment purposes. In this project I created a very basic portfolio design for beginners. The main focus of this project is to emphasize how hyperlink works. Moreover, this design is suitable for students during presentations and self introduction. The design is simple, student-friendly</p>
